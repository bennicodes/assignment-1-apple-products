I chose to create a apple website for iphone, mac and ipad (the most popular apple products). I got some inspiration from the official apple website, and som from rebull.

I wanted to create a simpler version but maintain the modern feeling of the apple website, where itÂ´s easy to navigate back and forth and improve the user readability and accessibility was in focus.

The reason I targeted _blank when you press the buy button on the product page is because me personally I don't like when the order/payment opens on the same page, because I have experienced that it can cause issues if you want to go back and change something.
